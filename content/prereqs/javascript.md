React is a JavaScript library, so it's fair to say that we'll be using a whole heck of a lot of JavaScript in this bootcamp. You ought to be familiar with the fundamentals of JavaScript before class begins.

## Basic

### Learn JavaScript by Codecademy

[Learn JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-javascript) is another free, interactive tutorial that replaced an older Codecademy course.

## Intermediate

### JavaScript 30 by Wes Bos

I highly recommend completing [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/) by Wes Bos. It's a series of thirty 20-minute videos, meant to be completed over the course of 30 days. That will take some planning on your part, obviously; you can't wait until the last second to dive into this stuff. But it's not a huge daily time commitment, and it will help a great deal.
